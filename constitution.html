    <h1 id="principles-and-objects-of-the-party">Principles &amp; Objects of the Party</h1>
<p>Pirate Party Australia strives to achieve the freedom of culture, the protection of civil liberties and inalienable rights of the nation’s citizens and to protect the freedoms of the newly evolving global information society. It is these values that the party seeks to have embedded within the laws and institutions of Australia.</p>
<p>The growing surveillance of the citizen offends the very notions of a liberal and open democracy. Overbearing and restrictive private monopolies constructed via regimes of antiquated, unfair and unbalanced laws which prevent the free development of culture and ideas are detrimental to financial, economic and cultural outcomes for the citizens of Australia. Changing these laws, and ensuring the protection of these values are the goals of the Pirate Party Australia.</p>
<p>Founded on the same principles as other International Pirate Parties, it is part of a global movement against increasingly draconian copyright and patent laws, and the erosion of the right to privacy. The basic tenets of this movement are Free Culture, Civil Liberty and Intellectual Rights Reform.</p>
<p>The Party does not seek to become part of the administration, but a mediator in parliamentary deadlocks, and to provide representation for the emergent information society, to guard the civil liberties of the citizen by utilising this power to further the party agenda, and as such intends to contest Australian Federal Elections in both the House of Representatives and Senate.</p>
<p>An elected representative of the party must not vote for or compromise on any legislation that impinges on or compromises the rights stated here in this constitution.</p>
<p>Objectives of the Pirate Party Australia also include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To construct, advocate and implement policies in accordance with the principles stated within this constitution; and</p></li>
<li><p>To generally educate and bring awareness to the issues that are stated within this constitution; and</p></li>
<li><p>To educate and encourage other political entities to adopt our objectives, whether that be through advocacy or preference allocation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Pirate Party Australia firmly holds belief in democracy, and rejects any use of force, intimidation or physical violence as the means to achieving political goals. We vehemently reject any and all forms of political or public corruption.</p>
